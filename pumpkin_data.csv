	• The pumpkin split completely in half
	• As you put the rubber bands on, an indentation begins to occur 
	
Thank you for giving our class such a memorable opportunity to make real-life estimates and test them to see whether our estimate was accurate or not. It was a LOT of fun. I will participate again with future classes.",,,150,,
